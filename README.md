# Project3
____
Main Problem / Object to solve
- 
- This project consisted of calculating values, outputting strings in certain formats and also reading in files

Tasks
-
- Create private and public variables
- Create classes and methods that may extend from other classes
- Using the Java API to help figure out small tasks
- Looking at previous labs to help figure out problems drawn by this project
- Creating methods to help elimate over coding
- Creating Hashmaps and tree maps and arrays where needed
- Correctly sorting in either descending or ascending order
- Implementing the ASCII table to calculate ASCII values for strings
- Implementing and using formatters for Strings to be parsed later in code


Issues
-
- Reading in and breaking the data from the Mesonet.txt file to where only the first column (STIDs) is collected and everything else is omitted
- Parsing strings in the format that the instructions wanted it in
- Storing new gathered data and storing that into a hashmap/ treemap
- Properly calculating what the instructions wanted from us
- Correctly sorting dates and figuring out in what sorting method the instructions wanted from us
- Getting the right string format to output the way Zybooks wanted
